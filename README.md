# Infrastructure Quality Assessment using Machine Learning and Google Maps

This repository explores the feasibility of using a Random Forest model to assess infrastructure gaps in rural India. The model leverages the Google Maps Places API to gather data on essential infrastructure like schools, hospitals, and markets.

## Project Motivation

Limited access to basic infrastructure remains a significant challenge in rural India, hindering education, healthcare, and overall quality of life. Traditional methods for infrastructure assessment are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inaccuracies.

This project proposes an AI-driven solution to address these limitations. By automating infrastructure identification and analysis, the model facilitates:

* **Efficient and Scalable Assessments:** Expedited data collection and analysis enable quicker and more comprehensive infrastructure gap assessments.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The model empowers policymakers and development agencies to prioritize resource allocation based on reliable data.
* **Improved Rural Development Initiatives:** Targeted interventions can be implemented to bridge infrastructure gaps and enhance the well-being of rural communities.

## Technical Approach

The project adopts a supervised learning approach, utilizing two key data sources:

1. **Manually Labeled Dataset:** This dataset comprises 20,000 data points, each containing information on the presence or absence of 12 essential infrastructure elements (e.g., market, school, hospital) within a village. It also includes a target variable indicating the overall infrastructure development status of the village.
3. **Places API:** This API interacts with the retrieved coordinates to identify the available infrastructure within the village boundaries.

The Random Forest algorithm serves as the core machine learning model. It constructs multiple decision trees based on random subsets of the data and aggregates their predictions to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using two key metrics:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of the difference between predicted and actual values. Lower MAE signifies better model performance.
* **R-squared Score (R²):** Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. A value closer to 1 indicates a strong model fit.

The implemented Random Forest model achieved an R² score of 0.99999988 and an MAE of 2.5e-06, demonstrating exceptional accuracy in predicting infrastructure needs.

## Future Enhancements

* **API Data Completeness:** The project acknowledges the potential variability in API responses, particularly for remote locations. Exploring alternative data sources beyond APIs could improve data comprehensiveness.
* **Model Refinement:** Continuous development efforts can focus on incorporating additional data sources and refining the model to achieve even greater accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the potential of AI and Google Maps APIs in assessing rural infrastructure in India. The Random Forest model offers a promising approach for data-driven decision making, paving the way for targeted interventions and improved quality of life in rural communities. Future work will concentrate on enhancing model accuracy and broadening its applications for resource optimization and rural development planning.
